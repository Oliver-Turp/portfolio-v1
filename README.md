## To Do list:

- Shorten the hamburger annimation some how or use another one. There is too many frames which no movement which means the user thinks the website is slow and unresponsive.

- Match up the timings for the mobile menu coming up with the animation time for the burger.

- Add in some fancy movements on the mobile menu. Perhaps the borders come in from the side one by one? May have to use :after elements.

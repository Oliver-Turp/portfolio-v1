- [ ] Pick heading & body fonts

- [ ] Adjust all fonts page by page

- [ ] Create and include favicon

- [ ] Complete websites [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P6KxT20elxEnuZJNfIiVeuYw5PXtGigUU_qf_05JrxE/edit)

- [ ] Complete discord bots [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/)

- [ ] Create customer feedback [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/)

- [ ] Make sure all google forms send me an email on submit

### Components:

- [ ] Update header links

### Homepage: 

- [ ] Change the home image

- [ ] Change the home buttons to link to the google forms (or use JS to open the forms in a new tab while navigating to the internal page in the current tab?)

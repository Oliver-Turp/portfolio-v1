## To Do list:

- [x] `npm i framer-motion`

- [x] Redo the navigation HTML so that there is a mobile and desktop version. This way one can have framer motion and the other can be free. Pay attention to CSS when messing with this.

- [ ] Match up the timings for the mobile menu coming up with the animation time for the burger.

- [ ] Add in some fancy movements on the mobile menu. Perhaps the borders come in from the side one by one? May have to use :after elements.
